# Instar
A poor attempt at making a game of UNO in a Discord Bot using Python for the **Discord Hack Week #1** in the **Entertainment** category.

**Current status:** `Work In Progress`

## Set up
- Have [Python 3.7.3](https://www.python.org), as of now the newest version, installed on PATH and a bot account created on the [Discord Application Page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).
- Pip install the `requirements.txt`.
- Rename the `token.example.json` to `token.json` and add your own bot token as the value of the only key in that file.
